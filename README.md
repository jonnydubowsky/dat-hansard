# dat-hansard

First, thanks to [Open Australia](http://openaustralia.org) for making this data so easily available.

My purpose in making this is to make [Dat](http://dat.land) archives of the data

But right now, this is really just **scrape-hansard**. I need to make the dat archives using the Dat CLI. 

All of which makes me think, duh, it would be best if Open Australia just made these archives and I synced it!

So, here is a repo for scraping the Open Australia easily-accessible data for whatever that's worth.
