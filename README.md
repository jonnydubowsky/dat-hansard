# dat-hansard

First, thanks to [Open Australia](http://openaustralia.org) for making this data so easily available.

My purpose in making this is to make [Dat](http://dat.land) archives of the data

## Datasets

* Members information
* House of Representatives Hansard transcripts
* Senate Hansard transcripts

The archived datasets are listed above. You can mirror them yourself by just running:

```

```

If you find that these archives have fallen behind, no one is mirroring them, etc. then it might be time to run this software yourself and create new archives. But for now, the best thing would be to mirror them by installing dat and running the commands above.
